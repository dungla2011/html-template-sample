                <p>Here is a guide which I’ve ‘stolen’ from our best travel expert, Ms. Mai Phuong, for you to
                    spend 3 days, 2 nights in Laos tour. She did make it on her recent trip to the city last
                    month. You can use it for your next trip or design your own one with the help of Mai Phuong
                    – EV Travel Expert.</p>

                        her 3-day, 2-night itinerariy in Luang Prabang.</span>
                </p>
                <p>Once you arrive in Luang Prabang, head to colonial style buildings Satri House, located in
                    the heart of the city. If you are interested in superior crafted wood furniture, oversized
                    balconies, spacious bathrooms, beautiful spa room, and fine dining overlooking the garden,
                    you come to the right place. All the rooms and suites are a blend of Lao traditional
                    architecture with colonial style. Here you can enjoy your private moments and watch the
                    everyday life of local people from your balcony.</p>

                <p>Spend a half day with the elephants at Elephant Village Sanctuary &amp; Resort. An English
                    speaking guide will pick you up from your hotel to the Elephant Camp. If you have any doubt
                    about riding an elephant for ethical reasons, you will change your mind when you see the
                    elephant’s treatment here. They are genuinely well cared for and the guides are very
                    knowledgeable, not only about their animals but their country in general.</p>
