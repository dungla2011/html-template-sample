                <p>HAASS:&nbsp; Well, thank you and good morning to one and all on this snow day that, in this virtual world, somehow doesn't quite feel like a snow day. Somehow I feel we've been a little bit cheated out of our normal day off. Hope everyone is well and safe and healthy. And welcome to today's meeting. It's an exciting, proud day for us at the Council on Foreign Relations because we are marking and indeed, celebrating, the first anniversary of Think Global Health, the Council's website devoted to examining ways in which changes in health are reshaping economies, societies, and really, the lives of people in this and other countries around the world. We have a case study, shall we say, going on right now, so we hardly need to underscore just how important and relevant this is. I want to begin with three sets of thanks before we get to the events of the day. One is I want to thank Tom Bollyky, who really is the driving force behind Think Global Health, but also some of his colleagues at the Council—Shannon O'Neil, Lisa Ortiz, Maria Alzuru, Joel Bousley, and Karen Mandel—it takes a village and it really is an extraordinary daily set of productions that goes into the site. Want to thank our partner here at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington for their contributions to this initiative. And I want to third, but not least, thank the Bloomberg Philanthropies for their support in making this site possible.</p>
